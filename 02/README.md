# Numpy Tutorials
This repository contains an ipynb file that has all the basic concepts of numpy and python. 

## Python

### Python versions
Starting with what is python and the version we are using.

### Basic Datatypes
This section clearly ecplains the different types of data types and how it is been used in the coding.

### Containers
In this sections, we can clearly see the detailed explanation of differnt datatypes Lists, Dictionaries, Sets and Tuples.

### Functions
In functions, I have learned how it is defined using def keyword.


### Classes
In classes, I got to know the syntax for defining classes


## Numpy
In numpy, I have learned the arrays, array indexing, datatypes, array math, broadcasting and numpy documentation.

## Scipy
In scipy, few modules were old. Instead of using the old modules, I have used a modern one in the assignement. I get to know how to import image data and resizing. I have also learned MATLAB files and distance between points.

## Matplotlib
In this section I get to know the plotting, subplotting and images.
